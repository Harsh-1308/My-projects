Global Mart is an online supergiant store that has worldwide operations. 
This store takes orders and delivers across the globe and deals with all the major product categories — consumer, corporate and home office.


As a sales manager for this store, we have to forecast the sales of the products for the next 6 months, so that you have a proper estimate and can plan our 
inventory and business processes accordingly.
